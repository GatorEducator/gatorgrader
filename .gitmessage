# Hello GatorGrader contributor!
#
# We just wanted to let you know that we care a great deal about
# making our Git history clean, maintainable, and easy to access for
# all of our contributors. Commit messages are very important to us,
# which is why we have a strict commit message policy in place.
# Please use this template to format all your commit messages:
#
#     <type>(<scope>): <subject>
#
# Please note that:
#
#  - The message is a single line of about 72 characters that
#    contains a succinct description of the change. It contains a
#    type, an optional scope, and a subject
#       + <type> describes the kind of change that this commit is
#                providing. Allowed types are:
#             * feat (feature)
#             * fix (bug fix)
#             * docs (documentation)
#             * style (fix formatting)
#             * refactor (improve the code, no new features)
#             * test (add new test(s))
#             * chore (maintenance or infrastructure)
#       + <scope> can be anything specifying the place of the commit
#                 change
#       + <subject> is a very short description of the change, in
#                   the following format:
#             * Imperative, present tense: "change" not
#               "changed" or "changes"
#             * Capitalised first letter
#             * Dot (.) at the end
#             * No spelling mistakes
#
# Thanks for following the GatorGrader commit message template!
