# This GitHub Actions workflow contains two jobs:
# -- First, Lint uses the latest Ubuntu image and Python 3.8 to check the code
# and writing for defects, using the Pipenv linting script and mdl
#
# -- Second, Test uses a strategy matrix to run the Pipenv test scripts for
# multiple platform configurations, and then uploads test coverage.

    # different Python versions and three operating systems without running the
